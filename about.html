          <p class="about-p lh-lg fst-italic">
            Narcissus is a genus of predominantly spring flowering perennial
            plants of the amaryllis family, Amaryllidaceae. Various common names
            including daffodil,narcissus and jonquil are used to describe all or
            some members of the genus. Narcissus has conspicuous flowers with
            six petal-like tepals surmounted by a cup- or trumpet-shaped corona.
            The flowers are generally white and yellow (also orange or pink in
            garden varieties), with either uniform or contrasting coloured
            tepals and corona. Narcissus were well known in ancient
            civilisation, both medicinally and botanically, but formally
            described by Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum (1753). The genus is
            generally considered to have about ten sections with approximately
            50 species. The number of species has varied, depending on how they
            are classified, due to similarity between species and hybridisation.
            The genus arose some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene
            epochs, in the Iberian peninsula and adjacent areas of southwest
            Europe. The exact origin of the name Narcissus is unknown, but it is
            often linked to a Greek word for intoxicated (narcotic) and the myth
            of the youth of that name who fell in love with his own reflection.
            The English word "daffodil" appears to be derived from "asphodel",
            with which it was commonly compared. The species are native to
            meadows and woods in southern Europe and North Africa with a centre
            of diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian
            peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely,
            and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century.
            Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division,
            but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders
            include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes.
            Some Narcissus species have become extinct, while others are
            threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.
